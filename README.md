# UPGD
Polarization information is used for underwater image enhancement





## Training


## Evaluation
First, you need to download the [trained model weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WlbWC6lkI91_r5qiIN8FQxUmSfADNCPS/view?usp=drive_link, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r0plhiHldewqS_l6JRcLDp8vLxWfLhFs/view?usp=drive_link), or retrain the model weights yourself.

In the article we tested a total of three datasets, if you need to test the indoor dataset, run test.py, outdoor dataset, run test_real2.py, ucpd dataset run
test_real_opt_data.py. They all load the same weight file, only slightly different in the data processing part

## Compare the results of the method

You can get the enhanced results of the comparison method at the following link. [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/106B5l0kuGnFfBCjcm50R8wzyw9VQal9p/view?usp=drive_link) or  [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ov5iFyIuQdLg0gUF6m5rCA?pwd=b6dp)(b6dp )
