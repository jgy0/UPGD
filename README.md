# UPGD
A Lightweight Polarization-Guided Plug-in for Underwater Image
Enhancement




## Ushape+PPM

### Training
This part of the code will be released after accepted

### Evaluation
First, you need to download the [trained model weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AOBtjGVVCA4w3jR5agVwh-A_pYUWiVg3?usp=drive_link), or retrain the model weights yourself. [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1AumnlX634cOP2I4dfRkqoA?pwd=zhth )(zhth )

In the article we tested a total of three datasets, if you need to test the indoor dataset, run test.py, outdoor dataset, run test_real2.py, ucpd dataset run
test_real_opt_data.py. They all load the same weight file, only slightly different in the data processing part

### Compare the results of the method



## PUIE+PPM

You just need to download our code; the other files that need to be executed for the train and test methods are the same as the original project code.

## ucolor+PPM
You just need to download our code; the other files that need to be executed for the train and test methods are the same as the original project code.
